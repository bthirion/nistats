nistats
=======

Nistats is a Python module for fast and easy modeling and statistical analysis
of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data.

It leverages the `nilearn <http://nilearn.github.io>`_ Python toolbox for
neuroimaging data manipulation (data downloading, visualization, masking).

This work is made available by a community of people, amongst which
the INRIA Parietal Project Team and D'esposito lab at Berkeley, in particular
G. Varoquaux, B. Thirion, J.B. Poline and M. Brett.

It is based on developments initiated in the nipy
`nipy <http://nipy.org/nipy/stable>`_ project.
